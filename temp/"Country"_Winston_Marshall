links edit History edit Early years 2007 2008 Mumford Sons was formed in December 2007 by multi-instrumentalists Marcus Mumford Ben Lovett Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane 4 Band members variously play guitar drums keyboard instruments bass guitar and traditional folk instruments such as banjo mandolin and resonator guitar 5 The band name originates from the fact that Marcus Mumford was the most visible member organising the band and their performances Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an antiquated family business name 6 A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in West London around the same time giving rise to the label West London folk scene Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggeration Mumford Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in the same general area at the time In an interview with the Herald Sun Marcus Mumford said It's not folk really Well some of it is and it's certainly not a scene Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package It's a community not a scene It's not exclusive 4 Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment Mumford Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as Noah and the Whale Johnny Flynn and Laura Marling for whom Marcus Mumford used to drum 7 In early 2008 the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope who as part of management company Everybody's also represents Keane and Laura Marling 8 It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford Sons were exposed to their future A R at Island Louis Bloom who began monitoring the band Bloom told HitQuarters that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal There was no one there for it just a few friends and they needed time to develop Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time 8 In February 2008 the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from Alessi's Ark Sons of Noel and Adrian Peggy Sue and others June 2008 marked the band's first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival 5 Mumford also toured Australia with Laura Marling whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight The experience helped inform his attitude toward Mumford Sons audiences which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable casual atmosphere 4 Mumford Sons' first project was an EP entitled Love Your Ground which took a year to complete and was released in November 2008 on Chess Club Records 5 edit Sigh No More 2009 2010 Throughout 2008 and into 2009 Mumford Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US exposing audiences to Love Your Ground tracks and other material that would eventually become Sigh No More The band finally recorded Sigh No More with Markus Dravs who had produced albums with artists such as Arcade Fire 4 At the time band members did not even own their own instruments Dravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed 9 The only track from Love Your Ground to be included on Sigh No More was Little Lion Man The band told the Herald Sun that they self-financed the album to avoid the artistic and technical compromises that sometimes befall studio-financed projects 4 They toured again in support of Laura Marling in 2009 and Mumford Sons were contributing musicians to her 2010 album I Speak Because I Can 4 10 Mumford Sons performing at Dot to Dot Festival in Bristol on 23 May 2009 In August 2009 Mumford Sons signed a licensing deal to Island Records in the UK to Dew Process in Australia and New Zealand to Glassnote Records in North America and Cooperative Music in the rest of the world and through its own label Gentlemen of the Road Dew Process boss Paul Piticco signed the band after having seen it at a US gig in 2009 and having appreciated its honest approach and unique sound 4 Their debut album was released on 5 October 2009 with Little Lion Man as the lead single Dave Berry of XFM named Little Lion Man his record of the week and in another interview with the band Berry said Screw 'of the week' it's my favourite track of the year BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe made Little Lion Man his Reaction Record on 27 July 2009 11 before naming it the Hottest Record in the World the following evening 12 In their first performance on US network television the band played their single Little Lion Man on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on 17 February 2010 This appearance was followed by a performance of The Cave on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on 26 February 2010 13 Mumford Sons have been commercially successful in Australia and New Zealand The single Little Lion Man has been popular by January 2010 it had topped the Triple J Hottest 100 list for all of 2009 Its margin of victory was the largest in the history of the chart 14 In November 2010 the band won an ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist 15 Sigh No More first reached number 9 on the New Zealand charts in October 2010 and subsequently topped the chart in January 2011 due to strong popularity of singles from the album 16 In a March 2010 interview Ray Davies announced that Mumford Sons will be appearing on his forthcoming collaborations album 17 Marcus confirmed this in an interview the same month stating I am more excited about that than I have been about anything before in my life 4 Mumford Sons performed the track Days This Time Tomorrow along with Davies on 12 February 2010 on Later with Jools Holland 18 Marcus Mumford and Winston Marshall on stage in Brighton 4 October 2010 In December 2010 Mumford Sons earned Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song Little Lion Man While they did not go on to win an award the band performed their single The Cave at the Grammy ceremony The performance earned positive media attention and boosted visibility for Sigh No More US sales increased by 99 in the period following the ceremony in February 2011 19 20 The album subsequently peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US 21 22 On 7 December 2010 in collaboration with Dharohar Project and Laura Marling Mumford Sons released an EP album recorded in Delhi India The album was recorded in a makeshift studio with traditional Rajasthani musicians and features four collaborations including multicultural mash-ups of Marling's spirited Devil's Spoke and Mumford Sons' To Darkness Sigh No More is certified 2x Platinum in the US 23 and 4x Platinum in the UK 24 edit Railroad Revival Tour In April 2011 the group joined Old Crow Medicine Show and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on the inaugural Railroad Revival Tour which was inspired by the Festival Express tour across Canada in 1970 that included Buddy Guy Janis Joplin The Grateful Dead and The Band 25 Travelling exclusively in vintage rail cars the three bands performed in six unique outdoor locations over the course of a week starting in Oakland California 26 Ketch Secor of Old Crow told American Songwriter that It s like we left all our baggage at home and just brought our instruments often writing new songs while on the train 27 We were just on these old rattling rails It was a railroad odyssey that would have made Woody and Doc tip their hats and blow their whistles 28 he says They appear in the musical documentary Big Easy Express directed by Emmett Malloy being made of the trip which premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival SXSW Film in Austin Texas 29 winning the Headliner Audience Award 30 edit Babel 2011 present The band continued to grow in popularity in 2011 winning several major awards and headlining larger shows and festivals In February 2011 they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success 31 They received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year with Sigh No More and performed Timshel at the ceremony 6 UK sales of the album subsequently increased by 266 percent 20 While touring the United States in early 2011 the band began writing songs for the follow-up album Keyboardist Ben Lovett credited the creative atmosphere of Nashville Tennessee with easing the songwriting process 32 While performing in Kansas City Missouri on 3 June the first stop of their US Tour the band announced they had been recording a new album initially set to be released in late 2011 They then performed several new tracks from the forthcoming album the title of which was not revealed 33 Mumford Sons played at the Glastonbury festival on Friday 24 June 2011 and then embarked on a North American tour on which they frequently performed songs from the upcoming album 34 They recorded two songs for Andrea Arnold's adaptation of Wuthering Heights one of which entitled Enemy is featured during the closing credits 35 In June 2012 Mumford Sons contributed the song Learn Me Right with Birdy to the Pixar film Brave which came to be called Not with Haste 36 On 16 July 2012 Mumford Sons officially announced the details of their second studio album Babel including the release date of 24 September 2012 and a track listing of 12 songs 37 A deluxe edition containing three exclusive songs was also announced A week later the album became available for pre-order 38 The lead single I Will Wait premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 7 August 39 40 On 29 August 2012 Mumford Sons recorded their concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado 41 The Concert was later released on DVD Vinyl and on iTunes as Road to Red Rocks The performance of I Will Wait from the concert was released ahead of the DVD on 9 September as the band's official video for the song 41 On 22 September 2012 the band performed two songs from the new album I Will Wait and Below My Feet on Saturday Night Live 42 Babel debuted at number one on the UK Album Chart and the US Billboard 200 2 3 It became the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK selling over 158 000 copies in its first week and was the biggest selling debut of any album in 2012 in the US selling 600 000 in its first week 2 3 and over a million worldwide The first phase of a 2013 tour in support of Babel was released in November 2012 43 In December 2012 Winston Marshall told NME that the band already have begun rehearsing and writing for their next album 44 Marcus Mumford stated that the band may experiment with electric guitars and synthesisers for the album 45 edit Musical style and influences The band members play multiple instruments in live performances Here Marcus Mumford sits at a drum kit The band uses bluegrass and folk instrumentation such as a banjo upright bass mandolin and piano played with a rhythmic style based in alternative rock and folk Much of Mumford Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence its debut album name deriving from William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing The track Sigh No More includes lines from the play such as Serve God love me and mend For man is a giddy thing and One foot in sea and one on shore The song Roll Away Your Stone whose title is most probably a reference to Biblical story of Lazarus though it may also reference the myth of Sisyphus alludes to Macbeth the song includes the line Stars hide your fires And these here are my desires which borrows and pares down Macbeth's line in Act 1 Scene 4 Stars hide your fires Let not light see my black and deep desires 46 In an interview Mumford was quoted as saying You can rip off Shakespeare all you like no lawyer's going to call you up on that one 47 48 Additionally The Cave includes several references to The Odyssey also referencing Plato's Allegory of the Cave from The Republic More specifically the song references G K Chesterton's book St Francis of Assisi in which Chesterton uses Plato's Cave as a way of explaining how St Francis views the world from God's perspective In addition the song Little Lion Man appears to be a retelling in dramatic monologue form of Chretien de Troyes' Yvain the Knight of the Lion which is the story of a knight who goes mad after betraying a promise to his wife to return to her Here's the elevator pitch on Mumford Sons U2 meets Old Crow Medicine Show at Bruce Springsteen's house They have Old Crow's rootsy instrumentation and vintage wardrobe and they share the Boss' heart-on-the-sleeve sincerity and world-conquering ambition From U2 the band takes a melodramatic sense of musical dynamics and singer-lyricist Marcus Mumford models Bono's strategy for rendering spiritual longing in terms that are accessible to a post-Christian world 49 Danny Duncan Collum U S Catholic Both Timshel and Dust Bowl Dance draw heavily from the John Steinbeck novels Of Mice and Men East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath Mumford in an interview even compared touring to a Steinbeck adventure Steinbeck talked about how a journey is a thing of its own and you can't plan it or predict it too much because that suffocates the life out it That's kind of what touring is like Even though there's a structure you know what towns you're going to and that you'll be playing a gig pretty much anything can happen In the documentary Big Easy Express Marcus Mumford recognises the Old Crow Medicine Show influence I first heard Old Crow s music when I was like 16 17 and that really got me into like folk music bluegrass I mean I d listened to a lot of Dylan but I hadn t really ventured into the country world so much So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music 50 Mumford acknowledges that the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London Ketch Secor Old Crow front-man concurs Those boys took the message and ran with it 51 Emmylou Harris was among the gateway artists who helped Mumford and bandmates Ben Lovett Ted Dwane and Winston Marshall discover their love for American roots music It started with the 'O Brother Where Art Thou ' soundtrack That eventually led them to the Old Crow Medicine Show and then deep immersion in old-timey sounds from America's long-neglected past 52 edit Discography Main article Mumford Sons discography Sigh No More 2009 Babel 2012 edit Awards and nominations edit American Music
