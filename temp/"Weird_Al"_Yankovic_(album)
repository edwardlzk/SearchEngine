parody of his song I Love Rock 'n' Roll songwriter Jake Hooker suggested to ace rock guitarist Rick Derringer that he would be the perfect producer for the burgeoning parodist Agreeing Derringer used his music industry prestige and convinced Cherokee Studios to record an album's worth of Yankovic's songs gratis to be paid from sales revenue Then in March 1982 Weird Al Yankovic stepped into a professional recording studio for the first time and recorded nine of the songs for Weird Al Yankovic 3 The huge irony of my life it was difficult for me to get signed to a record deal back in early 80s because all the executives were saying Oh you do that novelty music You're gonna have maybe one hit if you're lucky and then you'll go right to oblivion You know nobody'll ever hear from you again Weird Al Yankovic speaking with Bob Boilen on All Songs Considered in 2006 8 After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first-time album Jay Levey a Los Angeles artists' manager provided KIQQ-FM with a copy of I Love Rocky Road Impressing the program director of the Top 40 station he played it immediately I Love Rocky Road was one of the most-requested songs by the next day At the same time Tad Dowd head of the new record label Rock 'n Roll Records had been trying to convince parent company Scotti Brothers Records to sign the 22-year-old Yankovic The positive furor over the KIQQ playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros to offer a contract for Yankovic's first album 3 Scotti Brothers Records' contract planned an April 1983 release date for a twelve-track album I Love Rocky Road and eight other tracks were already recorded Another One Rides the Bus would be the original 1980 live recording from The Dr Demento Show and the last two songs Ricky and Buckingham Blues would be recorded at Scotti Brothers' own studios in Santa Monica California 3 7 edit Promotion Dr Demento helped promote Weird Al Yankovic August 15 2004 2004-08-15 David Rossi To promote the album Levy coordinated a three-week tour in late Summer 1983 across the United States' East Coast and Midwest for both Yankovic and Dr Demento Promoted as An Evening of Dementia with Dr Demento in Person Plus 'Weird Al' Yankovic Demento opened with recorded hits and short comedy films from his show before introducing Yankovic and the band During their three weeks the tour played in several famous clubs including Bottom Line in New York City 3 edit Album cover The album cover for Weird Al Yankovic was designed by Brazilian artist Rogerio The band chose Rogerio because of his MAD Magazine-like drawing style 9 10 The cover art specifically features individual elements that correspond with each of the album's twelve songs 11 edit Critical reception Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic 12 The Rolling Stone Album Guide 13 Eugene Chadbourne reviewer for allmusic felt that while Weird Al Yankovic was a detailed harbinger of parody to come the album does not hold up well on its own Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies Another One Rides the Bus My Bologna I Love Rocky Road for their comedic value in contrast with their originals songs he supposed to be pretentious overblown However also according to Chadbourne Ricky lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums and the original songs may not seem like they were written in ten minutes but the ideas behind them don't seem to involve that much contemplation They're like little bits of puff whose impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast 12 Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for All Songs Considered on National Public Radio in 2006 host Bob Boilen opined that upon his debut Yankovic seemed the epitome of throw-away novelty act 8 Reviewing Yankovic in 2008 Brian Raftery of Wired magazine wrote that Ricky introduced the world to an accordion-playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose In 1983 Yankovic was considered a fad of the time comparing him to parachute pants and Contras and thoroughly disposable 14 Musical databasing and review websites allmusic and Artistdirect rate Weird Al Yankovic three and a half out of five stars 12 15 edit Track listing Weird Al Yankovic is the only album in Yankovic's discography in which the accordion is prevalent in every song in subsequent albums it's only used where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect 16 edit Side 1 Ricky orig Mike Chapman Nicky Chinn arr Weird Al Yankovic 17 2 36 Parody of Mickey by Toni Basil an ode to I Love Lucy with Yankovic performing as Ricky and Tress MacNeille as Lucy 14 18 Gotta Boogie Yankovic 2 14 A play on words discussing a man with a boogie on his finger and his quandary therein I Love Rocky Road orig Jake Hooker arr Yankovic 2 36 Parody of I Love Rock 'n' Roll by Joan Jett 3 narrator expresses feelings about the titular ice cream flavor Buckingham Blues Yankovic 3 13 A blues song satirizing the socialite lifestyle of the Prince and Princess of Wales Prince Charles and Diana Originally the song was going to a be a parody of Jack Diane by John Mellencamp worried about spoiling a Jack and Diane movie deal Mellencamp shot down the parody Yankovic considered tweaking the Jack Diane melody to avoid the song being a true parody but decided against it and later rewrote it as an original song 19 Answering a fan in 1998 Yankovic replied the he would not rewrite and rerecord the song in light of the death of Diana 20 Happy Birthday Yankovic 2 28 Style parody of Tonio K one of Yankovic's favorite artists 19 A morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world including poverty nuclear holocaust and eventual solar cataclysm Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time Happy Birthday to You by Patty and Mildred J Hill and Birthday by The Beatles Yankovic decided to write his own severely twisted version of one 19 Stop Draggin' My Car

rejection of the stereotypical attitudes and accouterments of the hippie yuppie lifestyles Such a Groovy Guy Yankovic 3 02 Narrated narcissism specifically noting fashion demeanor dominance and submission and relationship breakup Yankovic wrote the song for a woman he was dating in homage of her previous boyfriend who upon the breakup asked her I m such a groovy guy Why would you break up with me Out of concern the individual may not be aware of his status Yankovic does not identify him 19 Mr Frump in the Iron Lung Yankovic 1 54 An audience favorite from Yankovic's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly 3 the song describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous Mr Frump in his iron lung until the latter's death edit Other songs It's Still Billy Joel to Me Yankovic's 1980 parody of Billy Joel's It's Still Rock and Roll to Me was originally planned for this album Wary of the song being considered dated three years later and doubtful that Joel would give his blessing the band never bothered to ask 25 Yankovic's parody of The Kinks' song Lola Yoda was written in 1980 during the initial theatre run of The Empire Strikes Back and a huge hit on The Dr Demento Show However the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker George Lucas and the Kinks' publishers delayed its release until 1985 3 edit Charts and certifications Weird
