with Knowles 3 West told MTV News that Jay-Z had asked him on the telephone for a duet for him and Knowles We got this joint it has to be the best beat you ever made 3 He continued So I went home and called my dog E Base who plays a lot of instruments up at Baseline studio for me and producer Just Blaze E came through I programmed the drums in 10 minutes and then he played all the different parts This version is all live bass live guitars live chords on it I brought it to Hov that night he heard it he thought of the video treatment before he thought of the rap He just knew it was gonna be the one 3 Tensions arose during the conception of '03 Bonnie Clyde over the sampling of Me and My Girlfriend 4 Senior Vice President of A R Tina Davis commented on the issue We only had one day to clear the Tupac Shakur sample from 'Me and my Girlfriend' that was used on ''03 Bonnie and Clyde' last year with Jay-Z and Beyonc Knowles We were back and forth with Afeni Shakur all day until we got the

Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song Me and My Girlfriend 3 Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track Me My Boyfriend included on Braxton's album More Than a Woman 2002 In a call to a New York radio station Braxton stated that Jay-Z and Beyonc are messing with my money They're trying to steal my mojo 3 Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002 and alleged that Jay-Z only decided to do '03 Bonnie Clyde after she played her version of the song for Def Jam Recordings 3 Braxton left stated I have kids to feed and this is taking money out of their college funds due to Jay-Z's sample of Me and My Girlfriend 38 Kanye West responded to Braxton's claim in an interview for MTV News I had no idea about Toni Braxton's song She can't act like ain't nobody ever heard 'Me and My Girlfriend' before People hear the song all the time I can understand her complaint if it was an original song 3 West defended the song's sample stating that the idea came to him after listening to a friend's Makaveli album one night 3 Roc-A-Fella Records' Co-CEO responded to Braxton's claims Jay is a talented dude I don't think he would steal anything intentionally It's an ill coincidence and things happen for a reason We'll see what happens behind it I read it in the paper and Jay and I were talking about it this morning and it was a little funny I know he didn't intentionally make the same record she made I don't think he even heard it My reaction is 'Sorry it wasn't intentional ' Jay makes records and puts them out This sh-- is music It's just music We don't sit around and have a blueprint to f--- anybody's life up The music business has been good to us I'm not getting into any beef or nothing over music 3 Speaking for MTV News Jay-Z responded to Braxton's claims I wouldn't want to take it from her I don't even think like that My first thought would be 'Maybe I could call her up maybe I could get on that record ' The most obvious explanation is it's neither one of our records It's not like you made an original idea She's not in hip-hop but it happens in hip-hop often We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first I'm sorry What can I do 33 He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song he would have arranged a duet with her 38 edit Formats and track listings Digital EP 39
