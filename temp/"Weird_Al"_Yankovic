Louis Yankovic June 4 1917 April 9 2004 7 and Mary Elizabeth n e Vivalda February 7 1923 April 9 2004 7 His father was born in Kansas City Kansas of Yugoslavian 7 8 descent and began living in California after serving during World War II 9 10 he believed the key to success was doing for a living whatever makes you happy and often reminded his son of this philosophy 9 Nick Yankovic married Mary Elizabeth Vivalda in 1949 Mary who was of Italian and English descent and had come to California from Kentucky gave birth to Alfred ten years later 9 Al's first accordion lesson which sparked his career in music was on the day before his sixth birthday A door-to-door salesman traveling through Lynwood offered the Yankovic parents a choice of accordion or guitar lessons at a local music school Yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over guitar was They figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world referring to Frankie Yankovic to whom he is not related directly 11 Yankovic said that his parents chose the accordion because they were convinced it would revolutionize rock 8 He continued lessons at the school for three years before continuing to learn on his own 7 Yankovic's early accordion role models include Frankie Yankovic and Myron Floren the accordionist on The Lawrence Welk Show In the 1970s Yankovic was a big fan of Elton John and claims John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album was partly how I learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion 9 As for his influences in comedic and parody music Yankovic lists artists including Tom Lehrer Stan Freberg Spike Jones Allan Sherman Shel Silverstein and Frank Zappa and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the Dr Demento Radio Show 7 12 Other sources of inspiration for his comedy come from Mad magazine 9 Monty Python 13 and the Zucker Abrahams and Zucker parody movies 14 Yankovic began kindergarten a year earlier than most children and he skipped the second grade My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of rocket scientist so I was labeled a nerd early on he recalls 9 As his unusual schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates Yankovic was not interested in sports or social events at school He was valedictorian of his senior class 9 Yankovic was active in his school's extracurricular programs including the National Forensic League a play based upon Rebel Without a Cause the yearbook for which he wrote most of the captions and the Volcano Worshippers club which did absolutely nothing We started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook 9 Yankovic attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo where he earned a degree in architecture 8 Career Dr Demento and early fame Yankovic received his first exposure via southern California and syndicated comedy radio personality Dr Demento's radio show saying If there hadn't been a Dr Demento I'd probably have a real job now 15 In 1976 Dr Demento spoke at Yankovic's school where the then 16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a cheesy little tape recorder The tape's first song was Belvedere Cruisin' about his family's Plymouth Belvedere was played on Demento's comedy radio show launching Yankovic's career Demento said 'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard but it had some clever lines I put the tape on the air immediately 9 16 Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses saying It was sort of like amateur music night and a lot of people were like wannabe Dan Fogelbergs They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads And I would get up with my accordion and play the theme from 2001 And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest 17 During Yankovic's sophomore year as an architecture student at Cal Poly at San Luis Obispo he became a disc jockey at the university's radio station KCPR Yankovic said he had been nicknamed Weird Al by fellow students and took it on professionally as his persona for the station 9 In 1978 he released his first recording as Alfred Yankovic Take Me Down on the LP Slo Grown as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of San Luis Obispo County The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as Bubblegum Alley and the fountain toilets at the Madonna Inn In mid-1979 shortly before his senior year My Sharona by The Knack was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the echo chamber acoustics and recorded a parody titled My Bologna He sent it to Dr Demento who played it to good response from listeners Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of My Bologna The Knack's lead singer Doug Fieger said he liked the song and suggested that Capitol Records vice president Rupert Perry release it as a single 9 My Bologna was released as a single with School Cafeteria as its B-side and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract Yankovic who was only getting average grades in his architecture degree began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music 9 On September 14 1980 Yankovic was a guest on the Dr Demento Show where he was to record a new parody live The song was called Another One Rides the Bus a parody of Queen's hit Another One Bites the Dust While practicing the song outside the sound booth he met Jon Bermuda Schwartz who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began 9 Another One Rides the Bus became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on The Tomorrow Show April 21 1981 with Tom Snyder On the show Yankovic played his accordion and again Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects Band and fame 1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr Demento's stage show His stage act in a Phoenix Arizona nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey who was blown away 9 Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career Yankovic admitted that he had so Levey held auditions Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass player and Jay's friend Jim West played guitar Schwartz continued on drums Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31 1982 6 Several days later Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons Yankovic recorded I Love Rocky Road a parody of I Love Rock 'n' Roll as recorded by Joan Jett and The Blackhearts which was produced by Rick Derringer in 1982 The song was a hit on Top 40 radio leading to Yankovic's signing with Scotti Brothers Records In 1983 Yankovic's first self-titled album was released on Scotti Bros The song Ricky was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young MTV Yankovic released his second album Weird Al Yankovic in 3-D in 1984 The first single Eat It a parody of the Michael Jackson song Beat It became popular thanks in part to the music video a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's Beat It music video and what Yankovic described as his uncanny resemblance to Jackson Peaking at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 14 1984 18 Eat It remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until White Nerdy placed at number 9 in October 2006 19 In 1985 Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a mockumentary of his own life titled The Compleat Al which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the Al TV specials The Compleat Al was co-directed by Jay Levey who would direct UHF four years later Also released around the same time as The Compleat Al was The Authorized Al a biographical book based on the film The book resembling a scrapbook included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents Yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for The Monkees in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of North America Yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with The Monkees despite the fact the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money 20 Yankovic also appeared on the Wendy Carlos recording of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf as the narrator in 1988 The album also included a sequel of Camille Saint-Sa ns's composition The Carnival of the Animals titled the Carnival of the Animals Part II with Yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of Ogden Nash who had written humorous poems for the original Rub n Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991 allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts A factual biographical booklet of Yankovic's life written by Dr Demento was released with the 1994 box set compilation Permanent Record Al in the Box 9 The Dr Demento Society which issues yearly Christmas re-releases of material from Dr Demento's Basement Tapes often includes unreleased tracks from Yankovic's vaults such as Pacman It's Still Billy Joel To Me or the live version of School Cafeteria New look and career to present Yankovic's classic look before eye surgery with glasses mustache and short curly hair He used it from 1979 to 1998 On January 24 1998 Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia 21 When Running with Scissors debuted in 1999 he unveiled a radically changed look In addition to shedding his glasses he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair He had previously shaved his mustache in 1983 for the video of Ricky to resemble Desi Arnaz and 1996 for the Amish Paradise video Yankovic reasoned If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years 22 He parodied the reaction to this new look in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for Hanson's River claiming his new look was an attempt to get back to the core of what I'm all about that being the music 23 Three of his latest albums feature the longest songs Yankovic has ever released The Albuquerque track from Running with Scissors is 11 minutes and 23 seconds Genius in France from Poodle Hat runs for 8 minutes and 56 seconds Trapped in the Drive-Thru from Straight Outta Lynwood is 10 minutes and 53 seconds long Before 2007 apart from a one-off performance of Albuquerque in Albuquerque New Mexico 24 these epic songs were not performed live in their entirety due to their length and complexity See Live performances for details Yankovic has also started to explore digital distribution of his songs On October 7 2008 Yankovic released to the iTunes Store Whatever You Like a parody of the T I song of the same title which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that I don't have to wait around while my songs get old and dated I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately 25 In 2009 Yankovic released four more songs Craigslist on June 16 Skipper Dan on July 14 CNR on August 4 and Ringtone on August 25 These five digitally released songs were packaged as a digital EP titled Internet Leaks with Whatever You Like retroactively included in the set 26 In 2011 Yankovic completed his thirteenth studio album titled Alpocalypse which was released on June 21 2011 27 The album contains the five songs from the previous Internet Leaks digital download release a polka medley called Polka Face a song called TMZ for which Bill Plympton created an animated music video and five other new songs 28 29 Yankovic had reported an interest in parodying Lady Gaga's material 30 and on April 20 announced that he had written and recorded a parody of Born This Way titled Perform This Way to be the lead single for his new album However upon first submitting it to Lady Gaga's manager for approval which Yankovic does as a courtesy he was not given permission to release it commercially As he had previously done under similar circumstances with his parody of James Blunt's You're Beautiful Yankovic then released the song for free on the internet Soon afterwards Gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client and upon seeing it online Lady Gaga granted permission for the parody Yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the Human Rights Campaign to support the human rights themes of the original song 31 32 Yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers 33 Personal life Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski in 2001 their daughter Nina was born in 2003 34 They also have a pet cockatiel named Bo Veaner 7 and dog named Bambu They used to have a pet poodle named Bela pictured atop Yankovic's head on the cover of his album Poodle Hat Yankovic identifies as Christian and has stated that a couple from his church appeared on the cover of Poodle Hat 35 36 Yankovic changed his diet to become a vegan in 1992 after a former girlfriend gave him the book Diet for a New America and he felt it made a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet 37 When asked how he can rationalize performing at events such as the Great American Rib Cook-Off when he is a vegan he replied The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I m not a student anymore 38 In 2004 Yankovic's parents were found dead in their Fallbrook California home apparently the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace that had been recently lit The flue was closed which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house suffocating them 34 Several hours after his wife notified him of his parents' death Yankovic went on with his concert in Mankato Minnesota 39 saying that since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times maybe it would work for me as well and that it would at least give me a break from sobbing all the time Although Yankovic played the concert as planned a scheduled meet and greet following the concert was canceled 40 41 Music career Main article List of songs by Weird Al Yankovic While Yankovic's song parodies such as Eat It have resulted in success on the Billboard charts see List of singles by Weird Al Yankovic he recorded an equally large number of original humorous songs You Don't Love Me Anymore and One More Minute 7 His work depends largely on the satirizing of popular culture including television see The TV Album movies The Saga Begins food see The Food Album popular music Bohemian Polka Polkarama and sometimes issues in contemporary news Headline News Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing serious music In his reasoning There's enough people that do unfunny music I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline 42 Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person or the song itself Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music with a separate unrelated set of amusing lyrics Yankovic considered that his first true satirical song was Smells Like Nirvana which references unintelligible lyrics in Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit 43 Other satirical songs include Achy Breaky Song which refers to the song Achy Breaky Heart This Song's Just Six Words Long which refers to the repetitious lyrics in Got My Mind Set on You the unreleased It's Still Billy Joel to Me and Perform This Way set to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song contrasting the style of the song with its content such as the songs Amish Paradise White Nerdy and You're Pitiful or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clich s such as eBay and Don't Download This Song Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and for legal and personal reasons does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans 7 There exists however one exception to this rule in the case of Like a Surgeon Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her Like a Virgin into Like a Surgeon Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager Jay Levey and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey 9 Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman Yankovic strives to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original While Sherman reproduced them orchestrally Yankovic and his band essentially play the original song with new lyrics Instead of using instrumental versions of the original songs Yankovic and his band transcribe the original song by ear and re-record the song for Yankovic's parody version 44 Sometimes artists whose work Yankovic parodies perform on the recordings e g Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' Money for Nothing and Money for Nothing Beverly Hillbillies Yankovic also includes a medley of various songs on most albums each one reinterpreted as a polka with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was the way God intended Because the polkas have become a staple of Yankovic's albums he has said he tries to include one on each album because fans would be rioting in the streets I think if I didn't do a polka medley 45 Some of Yankovic's original songs are style parodies for which he chooses a band's entire body of work to honor parody rather than any single hit by that band Such bands include Rage Against the Machine with I'll Sue Ya which features many aspects of the hit song Killing in the Name Devo with Dare to Be Stupid Talking Heads with Dog Eat Dog Frank Zappa with Genius in France Nine Inch Nails with Germs and Queen with Ringtone 46 Others are style parodies in the style of a genre of music rather than a specific band for example country music with Good Enough For Now and charity records with Don't Download This Song Yankovic has contributed original songs to several films This Is the Life from Johnny Dangerously Polkamon from the movie Pok mon The Movie 2000 and a parody of the James Bond title sequence in Spy Hard in addition to his own film UHF Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well such as Dare to Be Stupid in The Transformers The Movie One of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number 27 It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs and seen on the covers for Running With Scissors Poodle Hat 47 and Straight Outta Lynwood He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics videos and album covers He explains that It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to 48 Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob the Al TV interviews often mention the name 49 and a song called Bob is featured on Poodle Hat Frank e g Frank's 2000 TV and the surname Finkelstein e g the music video for I Lost on Jeopardy or Fran Drescher's character Pamela Finkelstein in UHF Also a hamster called Harvey the Wonder Hamster is a recurring character in The Weird Al Show and the Al TV specials as well as the subject of an original song on Alapalooza Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing or being owed 5 In a number of Al TV interviews he often asks if he can borrow 5 being turned down every time This motif also occurs in Why Does This Always Happen to Me in which his deceased friend owes him 5 Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general This also appears in numerous Al TV interviews as well as in several of his songs Albuquerque and Wanna B Ur Lovr to name a few Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could shave his back for a nickel This also appears in the song Albuquerque Yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs The first in Nature Trail to Hell said Satan Eats Cheez Whiz the second in I Remember Larry said Wow you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands 50 Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his mainstream parody targets such as Toni Basil MC Hammer and Men Without Hats 51 52 Yankovic's continued success including the top 10 single White Nerdy and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006 has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music 53 Music videos While Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part Most notably the video for Smells Like Nirvana uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit including using several of the same actors This video contended with Smells like Teen Spirit at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include Eat It Fat Money for Nothing Beverly Hillbillies Bedrock Anthem Headline News It's All About the Pentiums Amish Paradise Like a Surgeon and White Nerdy The video for Dare to Be Stupid is as stated by Yankovic a style parody in general of Devo videos 54 Several videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band Dr Demento appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos such as I Love Rocky Road and Ricky Actor Dick Van Patten is featured in both Smells Like Nirvana and Bedrock Anthem Drew Carey Emo Philips and Phil LaMarr appeared in It's All About the Pentiums Keegan-Michael Key Jordan Peele Donny Osmond Judy Tenuta and Seth Green appeared in White Nerdy and Ruth Buzzi and Pat Boone appeared in Gump The video for I Lost on Jeopardy includes an appearance by Greg Kihn the artist whose song Jeopardy was being parodied along with Don Pardo and Art Fleming Jeopardy's original announcer and host as themselves Florence Henderson played Yankovic's Amish wife in Amish Paradise While most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and VH1 Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums The DualDisc version of Straight Outta Lynwood features six videos set to songs from the release including videos created by Bill Plympton and John Kricfalusi one video Weasel Stomping Day was created by the producers of the show Robot Chicken and aired as a segment of that program As of fall 2010 Yankovic is again collaborating with Bill Plympton to create a video for a new song TMZ which will appear on his upcoming album 29 Reactions from original artists Under the fair use provision of U S copyright law affirmed by the United States Supreme Court artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a parody 55 However as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody 7 He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests 56 while many of the rest who approve consider Yankovic's parodies to be a badge of honor and rite of passage in the music industry Positive Michael Jackson was a big fan of Yankovic and Yankovic claimed Jackson had always been very supportive of his work 56 Jackson twice allowed him to parody his songs Beat It and Bad became Eat It and Fat respectively When Jackson granted Yankovic permission to do Fat Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own Badder video from the Moonwalker video Though Jackson allowed Eat It and Fat he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of Black or White titled Snack All Night because he felt the message was too important This refusal coming shortly after the commercial failure of Yankovic's movie UHF in theaters had initially set Yankovic back he later recognized this as a critical time as in searching for new parodies he came across Nirvana and leading to a revitalization of his career with Smells Like Nirvana 56 Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody Snack All Night in some of his live shows 24 Yankovic had a cameo appearance along with many other celebrities in Jackson's music video for Liberian Girl Yankovic performing The Saga Begins in Auckland New Zealand on March 10 2007 Dave Grohl of Nirvana said that the band felt they had made it after Yankovic recorded Smells Like Nirvana a parody of the grunge band's smash hit Smells Like Teen Spirit 7 On his Behind the Music special Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to ask if he could parody the song Cobain gave him permission then paused and asked Um it's not gonna be about food is it Yankovic responded with No it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics According to members of Nirvana interviewed for Behind the Music when they saw the video of the song they laughed hysterically Additionally Cobain described Yankovic as a musical genius 57 Mark Knopfler approved Yankovic's parody of the Dire Straits song Money for Nothing for use in the film UHF on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled Money for Nothing Beverly Hillbillies 58 Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for UHF explaining We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing 'slash' Beverly Hillbillies 'asterisk' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name Those wacky lawyers What ya gonna do 59 The Permanent Record Al in the Box booklet referred to the song's compound fracture of a title 9 When a fan asked about the song's title Yankovic shared his feelings on the title replying That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as I'm not sure why and I've obviously never been very happy about it 60 The Presidents of the United States of America were so pleased with Gump Yankovic's parody of their song Lump that they ended the song with his last line instead of their own And that's all I have to say about that on the live recording of Lump featured on the compilation album Pure Frosting In 2008 Yankovic directed the music video for their song Mixed Up S O B Don McLean was reportedly pleased with The Saga Begins a parody of American Pie and told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances 61 His parody not only replicates the music from the original Don McLean song but it replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus Additionally George Lucas loved the song and a Lucasfilm representative told Yankovic You should have seen the smile on his face 62 Chamillionaire was also very pleased even putting Yankovic's parody White Nerdy a parody of Ridin' on his official MySpace page before it was on Yankovic's own page Chamillionaire stated in an interview He's actually rapping pretty good on it it's crazy I didn't know he could rap like that It's really an honor when he does that Weird Al is not gonna do a parody of your song if you're not doing it big 63 In September 2007 Chamillionaire credited White Nerdy for his recent Grammy win stating That parody was the reason I won the Grammy because it made the record so big it was undeniable It was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of Weird Al's song 64 In 2011 Yankovic was initially denied permission to parody Lady Gaga's Born This Way for his song Perform This Way for release on a new album but through his release of the song on YouTube and subsequent spread via Twitter Lady Gaga and her staff asserted that her manager had made the decision without her input and Gaga herself gave Yankovic permission to proceed with the parody's release 56 65 Gaga considered herself a huge Weird Al fan 66 and she stated that the parody was a rite of passage for her musical career and considered the song very empowering 67 Negative One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's Amish Paradise based on Gangsta's Paradise by hip-hop artist Coolio which in turn was based on Pastime Paradise by Stevie Wonder Reportedly Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody but Coolio maintains that he never did While Coolio claimed he was upset legal action never materialized and Coolio accepted royalty payments for the song After this controversy Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show Yankovic and Coolio made peace On his website Yankovic wrote of this event I don t remember what we said to each other exactly but it was all very friendly I doubt I ll be invited to Coolio s next birthday party but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall 68 In 2003 Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for Couch Potato his parody of Eminem's Lose Yourself Last year Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career 69 For the Poodle Hat Al TV special Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a fake interview with Eminem As Yankovic has always done for his Al TV specials he edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect 70 Refused parodies On numerous occasions Prince has refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs Yankovic has stated in interviews that he has approached him every few years to see if he's lightened up 71 Yankovic related one story where prior to the American Music Awards where he and Prince were assigned to sit in the same row he got a telegram from Prince's lawyers demanding he not make eye contact with the artist 56 Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is a self-proclaimed Yankovic fan but when Yankovic wished to create a polka medley of Led Zeppelin songs Page refused 72 Yankovic was however allowed the very rare opportunity to re-record a sample of Black Dog for a segment of Trapped in the Drive-Thru 73 Paul McCartney also a Yankovic fan refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of Wings' Live and Let Die titled Chicken Pot Pie because McCartney is a vegetarian and found the parody to be improper 74 In 2006 Yankovic gained James Blunt's permission to record a parody of You're Beautiful However after Yankovic had recorded You're Pitiful Blunt's label Atlantic Records rescinded this permission despite Blunt's personal approval of the song 56 The parody was pulled from Yankovic's Straight Outta Lynwood due to his label's unwillingness to go to war with Atlantic Yankovic released the song as a free download on his MySpace profile as well as his official website and plays it in concert since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody 75 Yankovic referenced the incident in his video for White and Nerdy when he depicts himself vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia page Live performances Weird Al wearing his Atlantic Records Sucks shirt during a performance of You're Pitiful on August 8 2007 at the Ohio State Fair Yankovic often describes his live concert performances as a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza 76 with an audience that ranges from toddlers to geriatrics 42 Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies many costume changes between songs and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes 76 A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour for the Running with Scissors album Touring with Scissors was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000 4 Titled Weird Al Yankovic Live the concert was recorded at the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael California on October 2 1999 77 For legal reasons video clips apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos could not be shown for the home release and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance 78 2003 saw

well as numerous misspellings of his surname February 2007 2007-02 Songs posted to file sharing networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter Often his surname is misspelled and thus mispronounced as Yankovich among other variations Much to the disdain of Yankovic these misattributed files include songs that are racist sexually explicit or otherwise offensive A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics 106 Quite a few of the songs such as Star Wars Cantina by the pre-Lounge Against the Machine Mark Jonathan Davis Star Wars Gangsta Rap Yoda Smokes Weed Chewbacca The Devil Went To Jamaica and several more have a Star Wars motif 107 Some songs misattributed to him are not songs but spoken skits such as Sesame Street on crack which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler Yankovic cites these misattributions as his only real beef with peer-to-peer file sharing sites If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with That particularly bothers me because I really try to do quality work and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just well vulgar and awful I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet 108 A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page 109 and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website 110 In an episode of HBO's

methods were used to raise money for the cause such as a live benefit show held April 11 2006 and selling merchandise on the official website and eBay including T-shirts calendars and cookbooks 114 On May 26 2006 the campaign hit the then- 15 000 target just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork 113 However Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007 115 On February 9 2007 the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to 25 000 113 and as such the Fund is accepting donations again Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007 but he was not included among 2008's inductees 116 Similar to the Weird Al Star Fund a second fan-driven campaign called Make the Rock Hall 'Weird' has tried to enshrine him into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland Ohio for which he has been eligible since 2004 117 Previous attempts to raise awareness for the campaign and support Yankovic's nomination included a petition drive from 2006 to 2007 which raised over 9000 signatures an art competition in 2005 additionally a documentary film about the campaign is currently being developed 118 119 In addition to these efforts an ongoing campaign is underway in which supporters of Yankovic's nomination are requested to send sincere thoughtful letters to the Rock Hall Foundation's headquarters in New York 119
